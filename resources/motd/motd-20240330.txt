Correcting K-Cor image timestamp error on March 30, 2024

What happened:

On March 30, 2024, MLSO acquired the first K-Cor observations since the road
closure in Nov 2022 due to the volcanic eruption of Mauna Loa. On March 30, 2024
the observers arrived by helicopter and used a generator flown to the site to
provide power. No internet was available. Data were acquired but the computers
were not correctly synchronized resulting in the K-Cor computer clock being slow
by 6 minutes with an uncertainty of 1 minute.

What was done to correct the problem:

6 minutes needed to be added to the time of each image to correct the computer
clock error, e.g., a file with a reported time of 21:33:15 UT was actually
acquired at 21:39:15 UT.

Four changes were made to correct the problem:

1. K-Cor filenames contain the start time of the image acquisition. 6 minutes
   was added to the filename time for all Level-1 and Level-2 K-Cor images on
   March 30, 2024.

2. K-Cor FITS headers contain a keyword "DATE-OBS". This keyword contains the
   start time of a K-Cor image acquisition. 6 minutes was added to the value of
   the DATE-OBS keyword in the FITS header. The comment for this keyword was
   edited to document that 6 minutes was added to the timestamp.

3. K-Cor FITS headers contain a keyword "DATE-END". K-Cor images are integrated
   over 15 seconds to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise. This keyword contains
   the end-time of the 15 second integration. 6 minutes was added to the value
   of "DATE-END". The comment was edited to document that 6 minutes was added
   to this timestamp.

4. Additional comments were added to the FITS header immediately following the
   "DATE-END" keyword. These comments record the filename of the level 0 image
   that contains the original (incorrect) time and to document that 6 minutes
   was added to the level 0 time to correct a computer clock error.

The March 30, 2024 data have now been reprocessed with the corrected times. The
new processing version number is: 2.2.5 [6e6988c]. Any data with this version
or higher has the corrected times. The version number is stored in the K-Cor
FITS headers in the keyword: "DPSWID". This version was released on Sept 12,
2025. The reprocessing date is included in the DPSWID comment. Any Level-1 and
Level-2 K-Cor data processed on or after Sept 12, 2025 contains the corrected
times.
